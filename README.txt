This was a project I worked on to do basic arithetmetic on CSV files without using pandas. It helped me understand what goes into using pandas 
and helped me understand it on a deeper level. 

I converted the CSV into an array using string splitting, and I used maps to store relevant values. 

I also learned how to parse command line entries using the built in argparse libray, and how to write csv files easily using the built in CSV file.
