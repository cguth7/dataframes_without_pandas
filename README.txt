This was a project I worked on to do basic arithetmetic on CSV files without using pandas. It helped me understand what goes into using pandas. To be clear I did not implement any advances CS techniques with threading/vectorization. I simply implemented for loop analysis on the dataframe. 

- I converted the CSV into an array using string splitting, and I used maps to store relevant values. From there I performed fairly simple python to augment the values and create new values.

- I also learned how to parse command line entries using the built in argparse libray, and how to write csv files easily using the built in CSV file.
